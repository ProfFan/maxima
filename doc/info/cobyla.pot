"The algorithm employs linear approximations to the\n"
"objective and constraint functions, the approximations being formed by\n"
"linear interpolation at N+1 points in the space of the variables.\n"
"The interpolation points are regarded as vertices of a simplex. The\n"
"parameter RHO controls the size of the simplex and it is reduced\n"
"automatically from RHOBEG to RHOEND. For each RHO the subroutine tries\n"
"to achieve a good vector of variables for the current size, and then\n"
"RHO is reduced until the value RHOEND is reached. Therefore RHOBEG and\n"
"RHOEND should be set to reasonable initial changes to and the required   \n"
"accuracy in the variables respectively, but this accuracy should be\n"
"viewed as a subject for experimentation because it is not guaranteed.\n"
"The routine treats each constraint individually when calculating\n"
"a change to the variables, rather than lumping the constraints together\n"
"into a single penalty function. The name of the subroutine is derived\n"
"from the phrase Constrained Optimization BY Linear Approximations.\n"
