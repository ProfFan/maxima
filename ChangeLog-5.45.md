Additional improvements and changes:
------------------------------------
 * Windows installer: Admin permissions are now required (as for
   most Windows programs). Installation without admin permissions
   worked, but left some spurious registry entries after
   uninstallation. This should be fixed now.
 * Windows Installer: Updated ABCL, wxWidgets and wxMaxima.
