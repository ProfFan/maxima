Maxima 5.46-post change log
===========================

New items in core:
------------------
 * function powerseries: power series for function lambert_w
   (thanks to Dimiter Prodanov)
 * --init option strips any directories and the last extension from the
   given value.  This value is used as the basename instead of
   "maxima-init" for the name of the init file.  This is an incompatible
   change.
 * --init-mac and --init-lisp are now (deprecated) aliases for --preload.
   This is an incompatible change.
 * The variable $maxima_frontend_bugreportinfo allows the frontend to
   tell bug_report() how to report frontend bugs.

New items in share:
-------------------
 * package pslq: PSLQ algorithm for finding integer relations
   among inexact numbers (thanks to Andrej Vodopivec)
 * package nelder_mead: Nelder-Mead algorithm for minimization without
   derivatives (thanks to Mario S. Mommer and Andrej Vodopivec)

Changes in core:
----------------
 * Maxima/ABCL: Use the option --noinform for ABCL.
   This suppresses the startup messages from ABCL, so that e.g. the Maxima
   option --quiet *is* quiet.
 * Fix command line options for Maxima with ABCL.
 * Functions that return lambda expressions with free variables are
   now translated correctly.  Previously many of these lambda expressions
   would cause internal errors when called.
 * Array functions and subscripted functions can now be translated.
   Previously these would fail to translate with no explanation.
 * configure: If the user doesn't specify a specific lisp maxima is compiled
   with all suitable lisp compilers.

Changes in share:
-----------------
 * package contrib_ode: Fix name of Clairaut differential equation
   in code and documentation.  Was misspelled as Clairault.
 * package tensor: commit code from Toth & Turyshev paper for trace-free
   decomposition, for time and memory assessments
 * package namespaces: expunge this package, moved to Github
 * package ezunits: derive units for diff, integrate, and 'at'
 * function mnewton: optional argument for the Jacobian

Changes in Xmaxima:
-------------------

Changes in the Windows installer:
---------------------------------
 * Update Gnuplot, SBCL, wxWidgets and TCL/TK.
 * Compile a recent texinfo for building the installer. Maxima now needs
   texinfo 6.8, but 6.7 is included in the usual build machines for
   nightly builds, etc.

Unnumbered bugs fixed:
---------------------
 * commit 7a7114c: avoid call to undefined function expintegral_ei
 * commit fe1d8cf: avoid clobbering global state when autoloading
 * commit 70a5f78: expunge calls to 'sign' in share package distrib
Documentation:
--------------
 * Help can use html docs instead of displaying help to the terminal.
   This is enabled by setting output_format_for_help to 'html; it defaults
   to 'text.  Use 'frontend to display help using Xmaxima, wxMaxima or
   other frontends.

Build system:
