Maxima 5.46-post change log
===========================

New items in core:
------------------

New items in share:
-------------------

Changes in core:
----------------
 * Maxima/ABCL: Use the option --noinform for ABCL.
   This suppresses the startup messages from ABCL, so that e.g. the Maxima
   option --quiet *is* quiet.
 * Fix command line options for Maxima with ABCL.
 * Functions that return lambda expressions with free variables are
   now translated correctly.  Previously many of these lambda expressions
   would cause internal errors when called.
 * Array functions and subscripted functions can now be translated.
   Previously these would fail to translate with no explanation.

Changes in share:
-----------------
 * contrib_ode: Fix name of Clairaut differential equation
   in code and documentation.  Was misspelled as Clairault.

Changes in Xmaxima:
-------------------

Changes in the Windows installer:
---------------------------------
 * Update SBCL and wxWidgets.
 * Compile a recent texinfo for building the installer. Maxima now needs
   texinfo 6.8, but 6.7 is included in the usual build machines for
   nightly builds, etc.

Bug fixes for numbered bugs:
----------------------------
 * \#545: multivar taylor gives 1^2
 * \#608: taylor(x^a,[x],0,1) unsimplified
 * \#3026: missing info files not well-handled
 * \#3071: limit of expressions with signum not very powerful
 * \#3926: Various limits give UND where they should give IND
 * \#3998: Lisp error when parser encounters eof in a comment
 * \#4018: defint(foo,,0,inf) lisp error when denom(foo) contains %i
 * \#4036: prederror affects bigfloat calculations

Unnumbered bugs fixed:
---------------------

Documentation:
--------------
 * Help can use html docs instead of displaying help to the terminal.
   This is enabled by setting describe_uses_html to true; it defaults
   to false.
