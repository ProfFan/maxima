Maxima 5.46-post change log
===========================

New items in core:
------------------
 * function powerseries: power series for function lambert_w
   (thanks to Dimiter Prodanov)
 * --init option strips any directories and the last extension from the
   given value.  This value is used as the basename instead of
   "maxima-init" for the name of the init file.  This is an incompatible
   change.
 * --init-mac and --init-lisp are now (deprecated) aliases for --preload.
   This is an incompatible change.

New items in share:
-------------------
 * package pslq: PSLQ algorithm for finding integer relations
   among inexact numbers (thanks to Andrej Vodopivec)
 * package nelder_mead: Nelder-Mead algorithm for minimization without
   derivatives (thanks to Mario S. Mommer and Andrej Vodopivec)

Changes in core:
----------------
 * Maxima/ABCL: Use the option --noinform for ABCL.
   This suppresses the startup messages from ABCL, so that e.g. the Maxima
   option --quiet *is* quiet.
 * Fix command line options for Maxima with ABCL.
 * Functions that return lambda expressions with free variables are
   now translated correctly.  Previously many of these lambda expressions
   would cause internal errors when called.
 * Array functions and subscripted functions can now be translated.
   Previously these would fail to translate with no explanation.

Changes in share:
-----------------
 * package contrib_ode: Fix name of Clairaut differential equation
   in code and documentation.  Was misspelled as Clairault.
 * package tensor: commit code from Toth & Turyshev paper for trace-free
   decomposition, for time and memory assessments
 * package namespaces: expunge this package, moved to Github
 * package ezunits: derive units for diff, integrate, and 'at'
 * function mnewton: optional argument for the Jacobian

Changes in Xmaxima:
-------------------

Changes in the Windows installer:
---------------------------------
 * Update SBCL, wxWidgets and TCL/TK.
 * Compile a recent texinfo for building the installer. Maxima now needs
   texinfo 6.8, but 6.7 is included in the usual build machines for
   nightly builds, etc.

Bug fixes for numbered bugs:
----------------------------
 * \#545: multivar taylor gives 1^2
 * \#608: taylor(x^a,[x],0,1) unsimplified
 * \#1743: limit of trig expression
 * \#3026: missing info files not well-handled
 * \#3071: limit of expressions with signum not very powerful
 * \#3136: gruntz(atan2(x^2-2,x^3-2*x),x,sqrt(2),minus) => atan2(0,0) undefined 
 * \#3279: limit incorrect with domain:complex
 * \#3280: gruntz incorrect limit
 * \#3415: limit doesn't check for zero coefficients in limit((a*x+1)/(a*x+2),x,inf)
 * \#3592: Wrong limit
 * \#3834: abconvtest undocumented and possibly unused
 * \#3926: Various limits give UND where they should give IND
 * \#3972: gcl only: Autocompletion inverts command case
 * \#3985: integrate(sin(x*cos(x)), x), risch; causes unlimited recursion
 * \#3996: parse_string fails to parse string which contains semicolon
 * \#3998: Lisp error when parser encounters eof in a comment
 * \#4008: translator and prederror
 * \#4018: defint(foo,,0,inf) lisp error when denom(foo) contains %i
 * \#4036: prederror affects bigfloat calculations
 * \#4043: bug in to_poly
 * \#4050: Maxima can't handle limits of Fibonacci expressions
 * \#4088: maxima variable prefer_d undocumented
 * \#4094 Build warning in share: grep: warning: stray \ before #
Unnumbered bugs fixed:
---------------------
 * commit 7a7114c: avoid call to undefined function expintegral_ei
 * commit fe1d8cf: avoid clobbering global state when autoloading
 * commit 70a5f78: expunge calls to 'sign' in share package distrib
Documentation:
--------------
 * Help can use html docs instead of displaying help to the terminal.
   This is enabled by setting output_format_for_help to 'html; it defaults
   to 'text.  Use 'frontend to display help using Xmaxima, wxMaxima or
   other frontends.

Build system:
