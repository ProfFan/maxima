Description: Computer algebra system
 Maxima is a fully symbolic computation program.  It is full featured
 doing symbolic manipulation of polynomials, matrices, rational
 functions, integration, Todd-coxeter methods for finite group
 analysis, graphing, multiple precision floating point computation.
 It has a symbolic source level debugger for maxima code.  Maxima is
 based on the original Macsyma developed at MIT in the 1970s.  It is
 quite versatile, reasonably powerful and comes with extensive
 self tests.
 This package contains the files all maxima flavours require.

 This package contains a maxima that was compiled by sbcl: sbcl is
 much faster for some tasks than gcl while being slower at others.
 It also is able to create binaries that run on systems sbcl isn't
 installed on.
 If more than one maxima is installed at the same time this maxima
 is run if maxima is called as "maxima -l sbcl"

 This package contains a maxima that was compiled by clisp.
 Clisp typically is way slower than sbcl, but it contains fast bignum
 arithmetics and tends to be extremely memory-efficient.
 If more than one maxima is installed at the same time this maxima
 is run if maxima is called as "maxima -l clisp"

 This package contains a maxima that was compiled by ecl which
 performance-wise normally lies between sbcl and clisp.
 If more than one maxima is installed at the same time this maxima
 is run if maxima is called as "maxima -l ecl"
