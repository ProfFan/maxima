Description: A Frontend for maxima
 Maxima is a fully symbolic computation program.  It is full featured
 doing symbolic manipulation of polynomials, matrices, rational
 functions, integration, Todd-coxeter methods for finite group
 analysis, graphing, multiple precision floating point computation.
 It has a symbolic source level debugger for maxima code.  Maxima is
 based on the original Macsyma developed at MIT in the 1970s.  It is
 quite versatile, reasonably powerful and comes with extensive
 self tests.
 maxima-jupyter is a graphical front-end for maxima that provides
 many unique features.
